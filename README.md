#3D Matplotlib:
- Most of the time we have been working with 2D matplotlib.
- Matplotlib supports 3D plotting also.
- mpolt3D module is used to plot 3D Visualization.

```python
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
```
# Animation
-  Animation is the technique of displaying images rapidly to generate illusion of movement. Each image is called a frame. If we display 24 frames per second, human eye perceives the animation as motion.
- The easiest way to make a live animation in Matplotlib is to use one of the **Animation** classes.
- **Animation Class**

    - TimedAnimation
    
    - ArtistAnimation
    
    - FuncAnimation
    
  These are the child classes of Animation Class
  
  ```python
  
  import matplotlib.animation as animation
  
  ```
